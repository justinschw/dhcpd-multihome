# dhcpd-multihome
A library to configure a multihome dhcpd server

This is inspired by the dhcpd npm package. That package does not provide multihome (i.e. serving multiple networks on multiple interfaces) but this one does. I didn't fork that project because I don't know typescript, so I am writing this one from scratch.
